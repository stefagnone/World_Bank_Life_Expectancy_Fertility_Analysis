# World Bank Life Expectancy and Fertility Rate Analysis

## Project Overview
As a data analyst for the World Bank, I analyzed life expectancy and fertility rate statistics across different countries and regions for the years 1960 and 2020. Using R, I produced scatter plots for each year, highlighting changes over time.

The analysis focused on:
- Comparing life expectancy and fertility rate between 1960 and 2020.
- Observing regional trends and how they have shifted over six decades.

The visualization helps to understand the demographic changes and trends in different regions around the world.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: Data analysis and visualization
- **Data Visualization**: ggplot2 for plotting scatter plots

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Contains the CSV data file (`Datset_IA.csv`) and the R vector file (`RVector_IA.R`) used in the analysis.
- `Code/`: R script with the analysis and visualization code (`Web_Final_Stefano_Compagnone.r`).
- `Images/`: Contains generated scatter plots for 1960 and 2020 for reference.

## Key Insights
- The analysis shows a general increase in life expectancy and a decrease in fertility rates from 1960 to 2020.
- There are noticeable differences in demographic trends between regions, with developed regions generally showing higher life expectancy and lower fertility rates compared to developing regions.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the R script (`Web_Final_Stefano_Compagnone.r`) in RStudio or another compatible R environment.
3. Ensure the required packages (like `ggplot2`) are installed.
4. Review the generated scatter plots and insights from the analysis.
